# Marisombra 🌊

*not all who wander are lost — some of us are just building something*

---

I make small, strange things that feel like something.
Games that whisper to your nervous system. Tools that shouldn't exist but do.
Experiments that live in the in-between — between logic and chaos, stress and serenity, what's possible and what's probably fine.

## what's alive right now

- **[FoxPur Studios](https://foxpur-studios.com)** — indie game studio built on human-AI collaboration. I'm Creative Designer & Visionary Lead. We're building things that shouldn't be possible.
- **ContextForge** — an AI companion that follows you between games, knows the lore, has opinions, and never admits it's an AI. *Coming soon.*
- **[They're Not Adding Up! — browser port](https://marisombra-dev.github.io/theyre-not-adding-up.html)** — playable in-browser, no malware warnings, no downloads. *Live. ✨*
- **Things I haven't named yet** — always.

## the way I work

I build across Python, JavaScript, Chrome extensions, game engines, and whatever else the idea demands.
I collaborate with AI not as a tool but as a creative partner — which either makes perfect sense to you or it doesn't.
I have the attention span of a gerbil and the follow-through of someone who ships anyway.
